<h3> About Me</h3>

<body>
    <div>
        <p>A information technology veteran, I have been involved with enterprise networking, data solutions and business intelligence for the majority of my career. I'm passionate about the transformation cloud technologies are having on legacy systems,
            and am now AWS Associate Architect certified and am pursuing a professional certification with AWS. As an IT Administrator for government organization, I administered a network consisting of over 500 computers while maintaining employer’s
            intranet, troubleshooting and supporting Cisco routers and switches, architecting a Video Evidence Tracking Systems, and implemented automation systems for the Westfield District Court’s Summons Process. As a SQL Developer for Kaman's KDGB
            Distribution Division, I handled the migration of over 5,000,000 rows of data to SQL Server 2012, mapped over 5,000 fields from legacy ERP system to SQL Server 2014/2016, while writing and maintaining complex queries, functions, and stored
            procedures. I am seeking a position where my experience in legacy enterprise technology infrastructures can be leveraged with opportunities to apply AWS cloud-native solutions to deliver long term business value for my future employer. </p>
